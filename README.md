# POST
This is a rewrite of the Program to Optimize Simulated Trajectories (POST) by NASA.
It was written in 1975 and since then built upon. The fundamental program is described in detail in public papers released by NASA, which were used to write this version in Rust.

The Formulation Manual and Programmers Manual can be obtained [here](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/19750024073/downloads/19750024073.pdf) and [here](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/19750024075/downloads/19750024075.pdf) and are also included in the repository [here](/manuals/).


This project is only for learning purposes with two main objectives:
1. Learn Rust
2. Understand the basics of atmospheric trajectory optimization
